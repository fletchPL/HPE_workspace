    <h1>BAGIETY</h1>
    <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken,
       but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period
       so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this
       case, it don't belong to me. Besides,
       I've already been through too much shit this
       morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.</p>
